# Server Developer Test Whatwapp
## Framework
I have chosen a familiar framework that I curently use on work called Feathers.js(https://feathersjs.com/), it provides a quick and fast paced development with typescript for realtime applications
## Database
As long im used to mongodb with mongoose aproach as resquested this test is being developed with a SQL Database, I have chosen Postgres due the extense documentation in how to implement a solution using Sequelize.
